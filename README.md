documentation of this package on
[readthedocs](http://pyrlp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

### Development Environment Setup

You can set up your dev environment with:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethereum/<REPO_NAME>.git
cd <REPO_NAME>
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Release setup

To release a new version:

```sh
make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$
```

#### How to bumpversion

The version format for this repo is `{major}.{minor}.{patch}` for stable, and
`{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}` for unstable (`stage` can be alpha or beta).

To issue the next version in line, specify which part to bump,
like `make release bump=minor` or `make release bump=devnum`. This is typically done from the
main branch, except when releasing a beta (in which case the beta is released from main,
and the previous stable branch is released from said branch).

If you are in a beta version, `make release bump=stage` will switch to a stable.

To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify the
new version explicitly, like `make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"`
